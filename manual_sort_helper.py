manual_sort_helper.py

This script guides the user through the manual sorting step
of the sprite processing pipeline.

It does not modify files itselfâ€”it simply helps the user open
the correct folder and gives clear instructions on how
to organize the sprites.

It can be run standalone (interactive) or imported and called
from another script (e.g., pipeline_runner) with an existing path.
